                <p>
                    A sunset photograph from the beach near my cabin in England. 
                    This picture was taken during a romantic evening walk with my muse Tatiana. 
                    It reminds me of how fragile and short our lives really are, and how every moment must be savoured and enjoyed while we have the chance.

                <h2>Wasp on Flower</h2>
                <p>An extreme close-up picture taken with a macro lens. 
                    I spotted this feller while watering the flowers in my garden, and I immediately pulled out my camera to take a snapshot. 
                    He didn’t particularly like that, so he chased me around the house and managed to sting me on my arm before he flew off (and died probably).

                <h2>Dew on Leaves</h2>
                <p>A close-up taken in the woods near my home after a rainy afternoon. 
                    The dew gathered beautifully on the leaves like marbles on a tablecloth. 
                    It reminds me that summer is about to end, and we’ll soon enter the rainy autumn season. 
                    Its probably about time to purchase a new raincoat…

                <h2>Seashells on the Sand</h2>
                <p>
                    An up-close photograph taken during my stay in Greece. 
                    While taking my daytime stroll on the beaches in Crete, I came across these beautifully coloured shells and decided to collect them along the way. 
                    When I felt satisfied about the light conditions, I decided to arrange them on the sand and took this picture with a 16mm telephoto lens. 
                    The background is out of focus, creating a ‘bokeh’ effect, while the colours of the shells beautifully complement the white sand.

                <h2>Sunflower Eclipse</h2>
                <p>While visiting my Uncle on his birthday party, I came across this lone sunflower growing in the fields near his house as the sun was about to set. 
                    I immediately grabbed my camera and snapped a picture of the flower as it was perfectly covering the still barely present sun. 
                    I found it a bit ironic that a flower named “sunflower” would eclipse the sun.

                <h2>Flowery Fields</h2>
                <p>Took this picture while picnicking under a tree in the park with Tatiana. 
                    It shows a beautiful field of daisies growing across the grass, while the sun shines beautifully through the leaves. 
                    It was a beautiful and warm noon, and we enjoyed wine while eating Tatiana’s home made sandwiches.
