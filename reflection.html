        A difficulty we had translating the wireframes to the actual pages was the adjusting the size and resolution of the images as viewed on mobile and or pc screens. This was our
        first time attempting to make a site for mobile view and had to figure out through testing what attributes worked best for this transition. </p>
        
        <p>We tried different values for the image but after testing several solutions figured out that setting the image proportions with % was the best solution to keep the image integrity as to not strech it and to fill the screen nicely. 
        Solid values ended with the image seeming out of place and offsetting the symmetry of the other attributes. </p>

        <p> One of the main challenges was utilizing the @media attribute efficently since this is an attribute we did not utilize beforehand. We had to figure out how to most efficently
        sort the css stylesheet to adapt to this new attribute which took some effort. we had to utlilize this attribute a lot throughout the creation of the pages since within the wireframes
        we placed the images in significantly different manners based on the screen size. </p>


        <p>  We used picture attribute to be able to make the resolution of the image change based on the size of the screen it is viewed on. 
        This attribute allows for more flexibility white configuring the images and makes the images fill the browser viewport nicely. </p>
