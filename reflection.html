                One of the difficulties we had translating the wireframes to the actual pages 
                was the adjusting the size and resolution of the images as viewed on mobile and 
                or pc screens. This was our first time attempting to make a site for mobile view 
                and had to figure out through testing what attributes worked best for this transition. 
            </p>

            <p>
                We tried different values for the image but after testing several solutions 
                figured out that setting the image proportions with % was the best solution to 
                keep the image integrity as to not strech it and to fill the screen nicely. 
                Solid values ended with the image seeming out of place and offsetting the 
                symmetry of the other attributes. 
            </p>
        
            <p>
                We had different positioning for paragraphs, headings and images based on 
                whether they were on a mobile screen or a monitor. to do this we had to get 
                used to using flex attribute withing css to position these. We tested many 
                px flex-basis and flex-direction and after testing we figured out the ones 
                that looked like and fit our wireframes the best. This took a surprising 
                amount of time since flex was an attribute that we were not comfortable with using.
            </p>

            <p> 
                One of the main challenges was utilizing the @media attribute efficently since 
                this is an attribute we did not utilize beforehand. We had to figure out how 
                to most efficently sort the css stylesheet to adapt to this new attribute which 
                took some effort. We had to utlilize this attribute a lot throughout the creation 
                of the pages since within the wireframes we placed the images in significantly 
                different manners based on the screen size. 
            </p>

            <p>  
                We used picture attribute to be able to make the resolution of the image change based 
                on the size of the screen it is viewed on. This attribute allows for more flexibility 
                while configuring the images and makes the images fill the browser viewport nicely.
